NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RequiresExternal - make dists require external
    commands

VERSION

    version 1.009

SYNOPSIS

    In your dist.ini:

        [RequiresExternal]
        requires = /path/to/some/executable
        requires = executable_in_path

DESCRIPTION

    This Dist::Zilla plugin creates a test in your distribution to check
    for the existence of executable commands you require.

ATTRIBUTES

 requires

    Each requires attribute should be either an absolute path to an
    executable or the name of a command in the user's PATH environment.
    Multiple requires lines are allowed.

    Example from a dist.ini file:

        [RequiresExternal]
        requires = sqlplus
        requires = /usr/bin/java

    This will require the program sqlplus to be available somewhere in the
    user's PATH and the program java specifically in /usr/bin.

 fatal

    Boolean value to determine if a failed test will immediately stop
    testing. It also causes the test name to change to
    t/000-requires_external.t so that it runs earlier. Defaults to false.

METHODS

 gather_files

    Adds a t/requires_external.t test script to your distribution that
    checks if each "requires" item is executable.

 metadata

    Using this plugin will add Test::Most and Env::Path to your
    distribution's testing prerequisites since the generated script uses
    those modules.

SEE ALSO

    This module was indirectly inspired by Module::Install::External's
    requires_external_bin command.
